## Unreleased

### Added

* `ConsumesQueue`: opt-in `singleActiveConsumer` flag that declares the queue
  with `x-single-active-consumer`, electing a single active consumer (with
  standby failover) for strict FIFO ordering across multiple workers.
  Defaults to `false`; the queue-arguments table is unchanged when not set, so
  existing queues are unaffected. Compatible with quorum queues.
